The ISS will always be at the centre of the globe.

Longitude is negative going west, positive going east.
Subtract the camp longitude from ISS longitude.

difflon = ISSlon - camplon
difflat = ISSlat - camplat

If difflon < 80 degrees then display camp (west)
If difflon > -80 degrees then display camp (east)

If difflon < -280 then display camp (west over dateline)
If difflon > 280 then display camp (east over dateline)

Display position on globe 
difflonX = sin(difflon) * some factor depending on the size of the globe
difflatY = sin(difflat) * some factor depending on the size of the globe
